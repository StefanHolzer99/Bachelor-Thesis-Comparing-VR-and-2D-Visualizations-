# Bachelor-Thesis-Comparing-VR-and-2D-Visualizations

## Description
This project is part of a Bachelor Thesis about a cmparison of VR visualizations and traditional 2D visualizations. The tilte of the Thesis is "Immersive Energy Data Visualization: Comparing 3-Dimensional Virtual Reality with Traditional 2-Dimensional Displays through Austria's Energy Choices and Environmental Impacts" and was written at the Department of Information Systems & Operations Management at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. The 2D visualizations were done using Python and the VR scene was created on Glitch using A-Frame

## Introduction
In this thesis, the differences between traditional 2D visualizations and immersive VR visualizations were investigated. The goal was to understand which method provides better user experience and data comprehension in the context of temporal environmental data.

## Usage
### 2D Visualizations
+ Download the "2D-Visualizations_Energy-Mix_CO2-Emission-By-Source" file for just a PDF of the visualizations
+ To run the note book first load the 2 data sets "co2-by-source.csv" and "energy-consumtion-by-source-and-country.csv"
+ Load the jupiter notebook "2D-Visualization.ipynb"
+ Run the note book in a code editor (e.g. VS Code)
+ If needen, download needed libraries using a terminal
+ Run the notebook and it will put out the visualiations
  
### VR Visualizations
To look at the VR visualization and/or remix it on Glitch, use the following links:
+ Live Site: https://a-frame-vr-visualization.glitch.me
+ Code: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/a-frame-vr-visualization
The VR scene can be viewed directy in the browser using a screen or a VR device. To move around, keyboard and mouse or motion controllers work

### User case study results
+ Download "CaseStudy_Results.csv"
+ Download "UserCaseStudyAnalysis.ipynb" and run in a code editor
